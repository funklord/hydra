# project.md — Hydra

Working notes and conventions for this repo: what exists, what is next, and the
rules to follow while working in it. The full design lives in
`docs/architecture.md` — read it before making changes; where this file and the
architecture doc disagree about intent, the architecture doc wins, and where
they disagree about *current state*, this file wins.

## What this is

Hydra (working name) is a Linux/X11 desktop browser built on **Qt 6 Widgets**
(no QML) and **Qt WebEngine**. It presents a side-tree of tabs/links over its
own embedded Chromium, with a per-site security policy engine, and (planned)
kiosk mode, AI tree-sorting + ad-filter evolution, a media detector with
external-player handoff, and a KeePassXC-based password manager. **Android is a
planned first-class target, deferred until desktop is complete** (see
`docs/architecture.md` §19).

## Build & run

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build -j
./build/hydra                 # loads ./sample-tree.txt
./build/hydra my-tree.txt     # or a custom outline file
```

Requires Qt 6 with **Widgets** and **WebEngineWidgets** (Arch: `qt6-base
qt6-webengine`; Debian/Ubuntu: `qt6-base-dev qt6-webengine-dev`), CMake ≥ 3.19,
C++17. On Linux this is an X11 / XWayland app: `main.cpp` forces
`QT_QPA_PLATFORM=xcb` there unless the environment already set it. That forcing
is guarded to desktop Linux, so other platforms keep Qt's own default plugin.

## Build-verification state

**Builds and runs.** Verified on Debian 13 with Qt 6.8.2 and
`qt6-webengine-dev` 6.8.2: a clean `cmake --build` produces `build/hydra` with
no errors, and the binary starts both on X11 and headless
(`QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen`), loads `sample-tree.txt`, and renders the shell —
menu bar, toolbar, populated tree with its bold/italic/muted state cues, status
bar.

Two of the three long-standing trouble spots turned out fine: the
`QWebEngineHistory` `QDataStream` operators and the
`QWebEngineCookieStore::FilterRequest` field names both compile clean. The
third is real but not urgent — the whole `featurePermissionRequested` /
`setFeaturePermission` permissions path is deprecated as of 6.8 and produces
eleven warnings. It still works. Migrating to `QWebEnginePermission` would
raise the Qt floor from 6.4 to 6.8, so it is a deliberate decision rather than
a cleanup; see "Qt version floor" below.

### The interceptor is confirmed working

Opening a tab drives a real navigation end to end: the page loads, subresources
are fetched, and both of the interceptor's mutations demonstrably take effect.
Tested against a local HTTP server that logs every request it receives, with
the page served from `127.0.0.1` and its subresources from `127.0.0.2` — both
loopback, but *different hosts*, which is what makes the result attributable:

| Case | Result |
|---|---|
| No policy file | page, image and script all fetched; `Referer` present |
| `javascript=block` for `127.0.0.2` only | the script never reaches the server; the image **from the same host** still does |
| `referer=block` for `127.0.0.1` | all three fetched, `Referer` stripped from both subresources |

The middle row is the one that isolates the interceptor. Per-page
`JavascriptEnabled` keys off the **top-level** host (`127.0.0.1`, untouched
here), so only `interceptRequest`'s per-origin `ResourceTypeScript` rule can
explain a blocked script alongside a loaded image from that same origin. The
third row is likewise interceptor-only — nothing else in the app touches
`Referer`.

**Not yet exercised:** the ad-host list specifically. It runs through the same
`info.block(true)` path proven above, but pointing a name like `doubleclick.net`
at a local server needs either `/etc/hosts` (root) or Chromium's
`--host-resolver-rules`, which Qt's `QTWEBENGINE_CHROMIUM_FLAGS` mangles because
it splits the variable on spaces and the `MAP host ip` syntax contains one. So
the *mechanism* is verified and only the host-matching predicate is untested at
runtime. The cookie filter and the permission callbacks are also still
unexercised.

### Qt version floor

`CMakeLists.txt` requires **Qt 6.4**, and that number is derived, not guessed:
the menu bar uses the `addAction(text, shortcut, receiver, member)` argument
order that 6.4 introduced (the older order is deprecated from 6.4 onward).
Everything else in the tree is 6.0-era API. Developed and tested against 6.8.2.

Qt WebEngine is a **system dependency, not a vendored one** — it bundles
Chromium, must be ABI-matched to the rest of Qt, and is LGPLv3/GPL/commercial
(arch §2), so linking the platform's build is far simpler than carrying it. How
it arrives differs per platform, but the CMake side is identical everywhere
(`find_package(Qt6 6.4 ...)`, with `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` pointed at the Qt
install where needed):

- **Linux** — distro packages (`qt6-webengine-dev` / `qt6-webengine`).
- **Windows / macOS** — the official Qt online installer, `aqtinstall`, or
  vcpkg/Conan. There is no system Qt to inherit, so the version is whatever CI
  and developers provision; pin it there.
- **Android** — Qt WebEngine does not exist at all (arch §19.2). That platform
  goes through the System WebView behind the `WebViewBackend` seam, which is
  why that seam is step 3.5 rather than an afterthought.

Note that going beyond Linux needs one code change first: `main.cpp`
unconditionally forces `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=xcb`, which has to become
Linux-conditional before a Windows or macOS build is meaningful.

## What is implemented (build-order steps 1–3.5)

| Area | Files | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Shell / window | `main_window.{h,cpp}`, `main.cpp` | plain `QWidget`: menu bar, toolbar, splitter, status bar; tree + stacked chrome-less web views |
| Tree model | `tab_tree_model.{h,cpp}`, `node.h` | `QAbstractItemModel`, sort roles, id index |
| Canonical file | `tree_outline.{h,cpp}`, `sample-tree.txt` | id-tagged indented outline parser/serializer |
| Sorting / search | `tree_sort_proxy.{h,cpp}` | tree-order / title / created / last-seen + live search |
| Lifecycle | `main_window.cpp`, `state_store.{h,cpp}` | open⇄suspended, history blobs, LRU live cap (4) |
| Policy model | `policy.{h,cpp}`, `policy_engine.{h,cpp}` | packed 2-bit tri-states, precedence, JSON |
| Enforcement | `request_interceptor.{h,cpp}`, `main_window.cpp` | interceptor, cookie filter, per-page settings, permissions |
| Site editor | `site_policy_dialog.{h,cpp}` | shield popup, scope this-host/domain/global |
| WebView seam | `web_view_backend.h`, `web_view_factory.h`, `request_filter.{h,cpp}` | platform-neutral interfaces + shared block/cookie decisions |
| Desktop backend | `qtwebengine_{view,factory,interceptor}.{h,cpp}` | the only files that name Qt WebEngine |

Persistence: `policy.json`, `state/<id>.blob`, and the tree file all sit next to
the outline file passed on the command line.

## The WebView seam (step 3.5, done)

The shell no longer names Qt WebEngine anywhere — `grep QWebEngine src/` hits
only the four `qtwebengine_*` files, and `main_window.{h,cpp}` is clean. The
shape:

- `web_view_backend` — one rendered page: load, back/forward/reload,
  `apply_settings(view_settings)`, `save_state`/`restore_state`, a permission
  decider, and a `url_changed` signal. `view_settings` is four plain bools, so
  a reduced Android backend applies what it supports and ignores the rest.
- `web_view_factory` — makes views and owns whatever profile-wide machinery
  sits behind them.
- `request_filter` — the platform-neutral half of interception. Deciding what
  to block is just policy plus a host list and is identical everywhere, so it
  is shared; only the plumbing that delivers requests is per-platform. Android's
  `shouldInterceptRequest` reuses this verbatim (arch §19.5).
- `qtwebengine_view` / `qtwebengine_factory` / `qtwebengine_interceptor` — the
  desktop implementation, and the only Qt-WebEngine-aware code in the tree.

`main()` is the single place that names a concrete backend: it builds the
policy engine, the filter, and the factory, then injects the factory and policy
into `main_window`. Adding Android is meant to be one new backend pair plus a
different two lines there.

A side benefit worth noting: the deprecated permissions API is now confined to
`qtwebengine_view.cpp`, so the eventual `QWebEnginePermission` migration is a
one-file change that cannot touch the shell.

## What is next (in order)

- **4 — Kiosk mode.** Fullscreen chromeless, reflow-zoom scale, crop-via-clip,
  fit modes, idle-reset/watchdog (arch §8).
- **5 — AI reorganizer.** `AIProvider` (local-first, Claude as default
  external), tree serialization, non-destructive diff/accept with the
  no-node-left-behind invariant (arch §9).
- **6 — Interceptor consumers.** Media detector, download manager, and the
  filter-evolution loop (arch §11–§12), reusing the interceptor and the
  diff/accept UI.
- **7 — Password manager.** KeePassXC-Browser protocol bridge + `QWebChannel`
  autofill; Autofill as a policy_engine feature (arch §13).
- **Android phase (deferred).** System WebView backend, adaptive drawer layout,
  Intent-based player handoff, Android Autofill, SAF downloads (arch §19).

## Open decisions and risks

- **Decided:** AI provider = local-first, Claude default external, others later
  (arch §9.1).
- **Spikes to run early:** the `QGraphicsProxyWidget` geometric-scale path for
  kiosk (may render black on some GPUs), and local-model tree-sort quality.
- **Interceptor limits:** request-only — no inline-script blocking, no response
  headers; the optional local proxy (arch §10) is the upgrade path.
- **Thread note:** `request_interceptor::interceptRequest` may run off the UI
  thread; the policy_engine is only mutated on the UI thread and reads tolerate
  a stale snapshot. Revisit if mutation frequency grows.

## Code style and file naming

Same three rules as `../fuzzypickles` (`code-style.md` there has the worked
examples and the reasoning):

- **`snake_case`, not `camelCase`,** for identifiers this project defines. This
  holds in Qt C++: call Qt's own `camelCase` API exactly as it is
  (`setSourceModel`, `addWidget`), and keep every Qt virtual you override under
  its real name (`interceptRequest`, `closeEvent`, `lessThan`,
  `filterAcceptsRow`, `rowCount`, `data`) — but names *you* introduce stay
  `snake_case`, including classes (`policy_engine`, not `PolicyEngine`),
  enums, signals, and slots.
- **Tabs for indentation, spaces for alignment** — one tab per nesting level,
  spaces after the tabs for anything lined up within a line, so alignment
  survives at any tab width. **Do not run `clang-format`**; with no config it
  defaults to spaces and silently undoes this.
- **Lowercase filenames,** `snake_case`, except where a tool won't accept it
  (`CMakeLists.txt`, `LICENSE`, `AndroidManifest.xml`).

Hydra-specific, on top of those:

- C++ member variables take an `m_` prefix and are otherwise `snake_case`
  (`m_views_by_id`, `m_save_timer`).
- Pointers and references bind to the name: `QWidget *parent`,
  `const QString &path`.
- No project-wide identifier prefix (fuzzypickles' `fzp_`). Deliberate: the
  codename is provisional, and a prefix would make renaming cost more than the
  one `project()` line it currently costs.
- `#pragma once`, headers alongside sources, one class per file.
- Qt 6, C++17, Qt **Widgets only** — do not introduce QML/Qt Quick.
- Keep the platform-neutral core (`tab_tree_model`, `tree_outline`,
  `policy_engine`, `state_store`, `tree_sort_proxy`) free of platform APIs;
  platform-specific behavior goes behind interfaces (the WebView-backend seam,
  arch §19.2).
- Persisted files live next to the tree file: `policy.json`, `state/<id>.blob`.

One naming wrinkle worth knowing: the architecture doc's tri-state `Default`
state is spelled `policy::setting::unset` in code, because `default` is a
keyword. It means the same thing — no rule at this scope, fall through to the
global default.

## Commit conventions

- **No AI-attribution trailers** (`Co-Authored-By: Claude ...` and the like) in
  commit messages, and nothing elsewhere in the repo indicating AI involvement.
  Messages end at their real content.
- Documentation changes ride along with the code commit they describe rather
  than landing on their own.

## Licence

**GPL-3.0-or-later.** Full text in `LICENSE`; every source file carries an
`SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0-or-later` line rather than a copyright block.

This sits correctly under the Qt WebEngine dependency, which is
LGPLv3 / GPL / commercial (arch §2) — note that Qt WebEngine's own licensing
constrains distribution independently of what Hydra declares, so re-check it
against any distribution plan.

## Naming

"Hydra" is a working codename. Renaming = the `project()` line in
`CMakeLists.txt` plus the `hydra` target; nothing else depends on the name. The
architecture doc still carries the older codename "Browser Overlord" in its
title — same project.

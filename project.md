# project.md — Hydra

Working notes and conventions for this repo: what exists, what is next, and the
rules to follow while working in it. The full design lives in
`docs/architecture.md` — read it before making changes; where this file and the
architecture doc disagree about intent, the architecture doc wins, and where
they disagree about *current state*, this file wins.

## What this is

Hydra (working name) is a Linux/X11 desktop browser built on **Qt 6 Widgets**
(no QML) and **Qt WebEngine**. It presents a side-tree of tabs/links over its
own embedded Chromium, with a per-site security policy engine, and (planned)
kiosk mode, AI tree-sorting + ad-filter evolution, a media detector with
external-player handoff, and a KeePassXC-based password manager. **Android is a
planned first-class target, deferred until desktop is complete** (see
`docs/architecture.md` §19).

## Build & run

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build -j
./build/hydra                 # loads ./sample-tree.txt
./build/hydra my-tree.txt     # or a custom outline file
```

Requires Qt 6 with **Widgets** and **WebEngineWidgets** (Arch: `qt6-base
qt6-webengine`; Debian/Ubuntu: `qt6-base-dev qt6-webengine-dev`), CMake ≥ 3.19,
C++17. On Linux this is an X11 / XWayland app: `main.cpp` forces
`QT_QPA_PLATFORM=xcb` there unless the environment already set it. That forcing
is guarded to desktop Linux, so other platforms keep Qt's own default plugin.

## Build-verification state

**Builds and runs.** Verified on Debian 13 with Qt 6.8.2 and
`qt6-webengine-dev` 6.8.2: a clean `cmake --build` produces `build/hydra` with
no errors, and the binary starts both on X11 and headless
(`QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen`), loads `sample-tree.txt`, and renders the shell —
menu bar, toolbar, populated tree with its bold/italic/muted state cues, status
bar.

Two of the three long-standing trouble spots turned out fine: the
`QWebEngineHistory` `QDataStream` operators and the
`QWebEngineCookieStore::FilterRequest` field names both compile clean. The
third is real but not urgent — the whole `featurePermissionRequested` /
`setFeaturePermission` permissions path is deprecated as of 6.8 and produces
eleven warnings. It still works. Migrating to `QWebEnginePermission` would
raise the Qt floor from 6.4 to 6.8, so it is a deliberate decision rather than
a cleanup; see "Qt version floor" below.

### The interceptor is confirmed working

Opening a tab drives a real navigation end to end: the page loads, subresources
are fetched, and both of the interceptor's mutations demonstrably take effect.
Tested against a local HTTP server that logs every request it receives, with
the page served from `127.0.0.1` and its subresources from `127.0.0.2` — both
loopback, but *different hosts*, which is what makes the result attributable:

| Case | Result |
|---|---|
| No policy file | page, image and script all fetched; `Referer` present |
| `javascript=block` for `127.0.0.2` only | the script never reaches the server; the image **from the same host** still does |
| `referer=block` for `127.0.0.1` | all three fetched, `Referer` stripped from both subresources |

The middle row is the one that isolates the interceptor. Per-page
`JavascriptEnabled` keys off the **top-level** host (`127.0.0.1`, untouched
here), so only `interceptRequest`'s per-origin `ResourceTypeScript` rule can
explain a blocked script alongside a loaded image from that same origin. The
third row is likewise interceptor-only — nothing else in the app touches
`Referer`.

**Not yet exercised:** the ad-host list specifically. It runs through the same
`info.block(true)` path proven above, but pointing a name like `doubleclick.net`
at a local server needs either `/etc/hosts` (root) or Chromium's
`--host-resolver-rules`, which Qt's `QTWEBENGINE_CHROMIUM_FLAGS` mangles because
it splits the variable on spaces and the `MAP host ip` syntax contains one. So
the *mechanism* is verified and only the host-matching predicate is untested at
runtime. The cookie filter and the permission callbacks are also still
unexercised.

### Qt version floor

`CMakeLists.txt` requires **Qt 6.4**, and that number is derived, not guessed:
the menu bar uses the `addAction(text, shortcut, receiver, member)` argument
order that 6.4 introduced (the older order is deprecated from 6.4 onward).
Everything else in the tree is 6.0-era API. Developed and tested against 6.8.2.

Qt WebEngine is a **system dependency, not a vendored one** — it bundles
Chromium, must be ABI-matched to the rest of Qt, and is LGPLv3/GPL/commercial
(arch §2), so linking the platform's build is far simpler than carrying it. How
it arrives differs per platform, but the CMake side is identical everywhere
(`find_package(Qt6 6.4 ...)`, with `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` pointed at the Qt
install where needed):

- **Linux** — distro packages (`qt6-webengine-dev` / `qt6-webengine`).
- **Windows / macOS** — the official Qt online installer, `aqtinstall`, or
  vcpkg/Conan. There is no system Qt to inherit, so the version is whatever CI
  and developers provision; pin it there.
- **Android** — Qt WebEngine does not exist at all (arch §19.2). That platform
  goes through the System WebView behind the `WebViewBackend` seam, which is
  why that seam is step 3.5 rather than an afterthought.

Note that going beyond Linux needs one code change first: `main.cpp`
unconditionally forces `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=xcb`, which has to become
Linux-conditional before a Windows or macOS build is meaningful.

## What is implemented (build-order steps 1–7)

| Area | Files | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Shell / window | `main_window.{h,cpp}`, `main.cpp` | plain `QWidget`: menu bar, toolbar, splitter, status bar; tree + stacked chrome-less web views |
| Tree model | `tab_tree_model.{h,cpp}`, `node.h` | `QAbstractItemModel`, sort roles, id index |
| Canonical file | `tree_outline.{h,cpp}`, `sample-tree.txt` | id-tagged indented outline parser/serializer |
| Sorting / search | `tree_sort_proxy.{h,cpp}` | tree-order / title / created / last-seen + live search |
| Lifecycle | `main_window.cpp`, `state_store.{h,cpp}` | open⇄suspended, history blobs, LRU live cap (4) |
| Policy model | `policy.{h,cpp}`, `policy_engine.{h,cpp}` | packed 2-bit tri-states, precedence, JSON |
| Enforcement | `request_filter.{h,cpp}`, `qtwebengine_interceptor.{h,cpp}` | ad/script/image blocking, referer strip, cookie filter |
| Site editor | `site_policy_dialog.{h,cpp}` | shield popup, scope this-host/domain/global |
| WebView seam | `web_view_backend.h`, `web_view_factory.h`, `request_filter.{h,cpp}` | platform-neutral interfaces + shared block/cookie decisions |
| Desktop backend | `qtwebengine_{view,factory,interceptor}.{h,cpp}` | the only files that name Qt WebEngine |
| Kiosk | `kiosk_controller.{h,cpp}` | fullscreen stage, 3 scale paths, fit modes, idle-reset, watchdog |
| AI provider | `ai_provider.h`, `ollama_provider.{h,cpp}`, `claude_provider.{h,cpp}` | local-first seam; Ollama local, Claude external |
| AI reorganizer | `tree_serializer.{h,cpp}`, `tree_diff.{h,cpp}`, `reorganize_dialog.{h,cpp}` | metadata-only payload, invariant check, diff/accept |
| Media detector | `media_detector.{h,cpp}`, `media_dialog.{h,cpp}` | URL-shaped classification, segment attribution, Watch/Download list |
| Player handoff | `player_launcher.{h,cpp}` | PATH probe, capability routing, URL-not-pipe launch |
| Downloads | `download_manager.{h,cpp}` | queue, resume via Range, per-node association |
| Filter evolution | `filter_list.{h,cpp}`, `filter_signals.{h,cpp}`, `filter_dialog.{h,cpp}` | passive signals, dry-run validation, diff/accept |
| Password manager | `keepass_protocol.{h,cpp}`, `keepass_bridge.{h,cpp}`, `crypto_box.{h,cpp}` | KeePassXC-Browser client; no vault, no master password |
| Autofill | `autofill_controller.{h,cpp}`, `autofill_script.h` | QWebChannel bridge, origin gate, policy-governed |

Persistence: `policy.json`, `state/<id>.blob`, and the tree file all sit next to
the outline file passed on the command line.

## The WebView seam (step 3.5, done)

The shell no longer names Qt WebEngine anywhere — `grep QWebEngine src/` hits
only the four `qtwebengine_*` files, and `main_window.{h,cpp}` is clean. The
shape:

- `web_view_backend` — one rendered page: load, back/forward/reload,
  `apply_settings(view_settings)`, `save_state`/`restore_state`, a permission
  decider, and a `url_changed` signal. `view_settings` is plain bools, so
  a reduced Android backend applies what it supports and ignores the rest.
- `web_view_factory` — makes views and owns whatever profile-wide machinery
  sits behind them.
- `request_filter` — the platform-neutral half of interception. Deciding what
  to block is just policy plus a host list and is identical everywhere, so it
  is shared; only the plumbing that delivers requests is per-platform. Android's
  `shouldInterceptRequest` reuses this verbatim (arch §19.5).
- `qtwebengine_view` / `qtwebengine_factory` / `qtwebengine_interceptor` — the
  desktop implementation, and the only Qt-WebEngine-aware code in the tree.

`main()` is the single place that names a concrete backend: it builds the
policy engine, the filter, and the factory, then injects the factory and policy
into `main_window`. Adding Android is meant to be one new backend pair plus a
different two lines there.

A side benefit worth noting: the deprecated permissions API is now confined to
`qtwebengine_view.cpp`, so the eventual `QWebEnginePermission` migration is a
one-file change that cannot touch the shell.

## Kiosk mode (step 4, done)

`kiosk_controller` + `kiosk_config`, reached from **View → Kiosk Mode (F11)**,
Esc to leave. It borrows the current view's widget into a frameless fullscreen
stage of its own for the duration — which is what makes "strip all chrome" free,
since the stage has none — and hands it back on exit.

Three scale paths (arch §8.1), because they fail differently:

- **reflow** (default) — one zoom factor, the page re-lays out. Always works.
- **none** — crop via clip: native size, positioned by alignment, overflow
  clipped by the stage. No transform anywhere, so nothing can go wrong.
- **geometric** — `QGraphicsProxyWidget` transform. Exact layout, no reflow,
  and the only path that can do genuine per-axis `stretch`.

`fit_mode` (contain/cover/stretch/actual) composes with those; the header
documents which pairs are meaningful. Reflow cannot do `stretch` — one zoom
factor cannot scale axes independently — so it approximates with cover rather
than pretending. Also implemented: idle-reset to the home URL, a watchdog that
reloads on render-process death, cursor auto-hide, scrollbars and context menu
off, and an `allow_escape` flag for lockdown.

**The geometric spike is answered: it renders correctly here** (Qt 6.8.2 / X11,
1280×720 design scaled 1.5× to 1920×1080 — real content, not black). One data
point on one GPU, so re-test on any new deployment target. Two traps found
while getting there, both now handled:

- `QGraphicsProxyWidget::setWidget()` refuses a widget that still has a parent,
  warns to the console, and leaves the scene empty — which looks exactly like
  the black-render failure it is supposed to detect. Detach first, and fall
  back to reflow if the embed returns null.
- Tearing the shell down while a session is live was a use-after-free: the
  controller hands the borrowed widget back to a stack that has already been
  destroyed. Fixed with `QPointer` throughout plus a `~main_window` that exits
  kiosk while its children still exist.

**Not done from §8:** the off-the-record profile (a factory-level concern),
`disableInput`, an escape *gesture* as opposed to the flag, and any settings UI
— `kiosk_config` is currently code-level defaults with no way to edit it from
the app.

## AI reorganizer (step 5, done)

**Tools → Reorganize Tree with AI…**  The pipeline is arch §9.2 verbatim:
review payload → send → receive → check invariants → diff → cherry-pick →
apply. The live tree is untouched until Accept; the proposal is parsed into a
shadow tree the dialog owns and deletes.

**Provider seam.** `ai_provider` is one text request, one text reply — so the
reorganizer, the later filter-evolution loop, and the diff/accept pipeline are
all provider-agnostic. Resolution is local-first: `ollama_provider` if a local
server answers, else `claude_provider` if `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set, else the
feature says so and does nothing. There is no official Anthropic SDK for C++,
so the Claude adapter speaks the REST endpoint directly (`anthropic-version:
2023-06-01`, model `claude-opus-5`, no `temperature`/`top_p` — that model
rejects them). A refusal arrives as a normal 200, so it is checked before the
response body is read.

**What travels** (§9.3): per node, id, parent/depth, title, URL, type, tags —
and nothing else. `tree_serializer` is deliberately not the canonical outline:
it drops the `created=` / `seen=` timestamps the on-disk file keeps, because
browsing history is not on §9.3's list and should not travel just because it
shares a file. State blobs and live views never come near it. The
review-before-send page shows the exact payload, and nothing is sent until the
user presses Send.

**The safety core** (§9.4) is `tree_diff::check_and_repair`, and it runs before
any diff is shown. The invariant: every original *leaf* id appears exactly once
in the proposal. Folders are the model's to invent, rename and drop; tabs are
not. So dropped leaves are re-attached and duplicates collapsed rather than
surfaced as a diff that could lose a tab — while an **invented leaf id fails the
whole proposal**, since there is no safe repair for a fabricated tab and
accepting one would put it in the user's tree. A leaf silently converted to a
folder counts as invented for the same reason.

Verified offline against 19 cases, all passing: timestamps absent from the
payload; a dropped tab restored; duplicates collapsed to one; an invented leaf
rejected by id; a leaf→folder conversion rejected; new folders allowed and
counted; moves computed and applied with the leaf count preserved; a prose-only
reply parsing to nothing rather than an empty tree (an empty proposal is a
provider failure, not a request to delete everything); a fenced/prose-wrapped
reply still parsing; and a move into a node's own subtree refused.

**Not done from §9:** the undo snapshot (§9.4's one-keystroke revert — the
cherry-pick UI covers accept-time control, but there is no post-apply undo), the
web-session provider (§9.1 rates it least preferred), and merging on the
duplicate-URL changes — those are detected and listed, never pre-selected, and
applying one is currently a no-op.

**Neither provider has been exercised against a live endpoint** — no Ollama and
no API key in the development environment. The request/response shapes follow
the documented contracts, but the first real call is unverified.

## Interceptor consumers (step 6, done)

Both features consume the one request stream the blocker already rides (§10)
rather than adding a second sensor: `request_filter` gained a
`request_observer` seam and the interceptor notifies it for every request,
blocked or not — the media detector wants what loaded, filter evolution wants
what slipped through. Observers are called off the UI thread and are
mutex-guarded accordingly.

**Media (§11).** `media_detector` classifies by URL shape, which is all a
request-only interceptor can do; real Content-Types and manifest bodies need
the optional local proxy (§10). Segments (`.ts`, `.m4s`) are tracked but never
offered for saving — they exist to answer *which stream is playing*, and each
is credited to the manifest sharing the longest directory prefix, so the one
being fetched sorts first. That is §11.3's primary-stream heuristic, made
answerable without response bodies.

`player_launcher` probes `PATH` and resolves the default from what is present —
it never assumes mpv exists. Launch always hands over a **URL, never a stdin
pipe**, because a pipe has no random access and the player could not seek.
Routing is capability-aware: handing a manifest to classic mplayer warns
explicitly rather than stumbling silently. `download_manager` is one queue with
`Range`-based resume and jobs tagged with the node they came from; it refuses
manifests rather than saving playlist text and calling it a video.

**Filter evolution (§12).** `filter_signals` logs third-party ad-shaped
requests that were *not* blocked — a blocked one is the system working, not a
gap — and never flags a first-party request, since proposing a rule against one
is how a filter list breaks the page it was meant to fix.
`filter_list::evaluate` is the safety core and the analogue of the
reorganizer's invariant check: nothing reaches the accept UI until a static
breadth check and a simulation against the page's real observed requests have
both run. A bare TLD, the page's own origin, an undomained cosmetic rule and a
generic-tag selector are rejected outright; survivors are shown with exactly
what they would block, and one matching nothing observed is left unticked as
unproven rather than wrong. Accepted rules merge into `filters-ai.txt`, apart
from any imported EasyList (§12.5).

Verified offline across 23 cases, all passing — classification and the
saveable/segment split, segment attribution picking the right primary, blocked
media not offered, all four dangerous-rule rejections, the dry run reporting
exactly what it matches, first-party and already-blocked requests excluded from
signals, and `||host^` matching subdomains but not a suffix-only lookalike.

**Not done from §11–§12:** segment assembly and the ffmpeg remux, tee-to-disk
for scrubbing a live stream, the local proxy that would inject Referer/cookies
for CDNs that 403 a naked stream URL, a downloads window, the per-site
auto-detect toggle, and regression re-runs over a known-clean page set.

## Password manager (step 7, done)

**Tools → Connect to KeePassXC…**  The design choice §13 leads with is what
this does *not* do: no `.kdbx` parsing, no master password, no vault of our
own. KeePassXC is already an unlocked local daemon in the session, so Hydra
becomes a first-class client of it. Transport is the Unix socket directly —
`keepassxc-proxy` exists only to bridge stdio for sandboxed extensions and a
native app skips it.

**The protocol is split from the crypto and the socket**, the same way
`request_filter` is split from the interceptor. `keepass_protocol` is pure
functions: message shapes, reply parsing, and the per-message nonce discipline.
That is where protocol bugs live, and keeping it free of libsodium and sockets
means it is testable with neither installed.

**libsodium is optional at build time.** Without it `crypto_box` reports
`available() == false`, the bridge refuses to start, and the menu item is
disabled — the protocol is end-to-end encrypted (X25519 + XSalsa20-Poly1305),
so there is no degraded mode worth offering, but an optional dependency should
not break the build. Install `libsodium-dev` to enable it.

**Autofill** injects a content script at document creation into an isolated
world, talking to `autofill_controller` over `QWebChannel`. The script does the
field detection every password manager has to do — `type=password`,
`autocomplete` values, name/id/aria heuristics — assigns through the native
value setter so framework-managed inputs see the change, and **never
auto-submits**.

The security rules are enforced in C++, not trusted to the script, because a
page can rewrite anything in its own document:

- **The page does not choose the origin it asks about.** The shell sets it from
  the view's real URL on navigation; a request naming anything else is refused.
  That is what stops a cross-origin iframe asking for the top page's
  credentials, and a lookalike asking for the real site's.
- **Autofill is a policy_engine feature**, so the shield's tri-state and the
  global default govern it exactly like JavaScript or cookies.
- **HTTPS-only by default** — filling a password over plain HTTP puts it on the
  wire.
- Credentials are held only for the fill that asked, and a navigation
  invalidates any request in flight.

Verified offline across 20 cases, all passing: nonce increment including the
carry into byte 1 and the full all-`0xFF` wrap (a nonce reuse is the one
failure this protocol cannot tolerate); message shapes including that the
envelope carries only ciphertext and leaks no plaintext URL; both error reply
shapes, and that an error reply yields no entries; and the full origin gate —
a different origin, an empty one, a suffix lookalike (`bank.test.evil.test`),
plain HTTP, and a policy-blocked site each refused, with navigation
re-pointing the gate.

**libsodium is now installed here, so the crypto path is verified**: X25519
keypairs, a seal/open round-trip, and rejection of a tampered ciphertext, a
wrong nonce and a wrong key all pass. What remains unexercised is everything
above the crypto — the socket handshake, association, and `get-logins` have
never run, because KeePassXC itself is not installed. Also not done from §13: the key icon and entry-picker UI (a single
match fills automatically; multiple matches are deliberately left alone rather
than guessed at), `set-login` on new-credential submit, `generate-password`,
storing the association key encrypted at rest via Secret Service — it is in
memory only, so pairing does not survive a restart — and the optional
direct-`.kdbx` fallback, which §13.4 recommends against anyway.

**This also unblocks §12.1's element picker**, which was deferred from step 6
for exactly this plumbing. It is not built yet, but the injection and bridge
seam it needs now exists.

## Local proxy (§10, player-facing half)

`local_proxy` is a loopback HTTP relay that solves the §11.3 problem: a naked
stream URL frequently 403s, because the CDN expects the same Referer, cookies
and User-Agent the page carried. Rather than depend on whichever header flags a
given player supports — they vary, and mplayer's are limited — "Watch in
player" now publishes the stream to the proxy and hands over a localhost URL,
and the proxy replays the context upstream.

Two properties carry the feature:

- **Range transparency.** A player's `Range: bytes=X-Y` is forwarded verbatim
  and the `206` comes back with `Content-Range` and `Accept-Ranges` intact.
  Without this the player cannot seek, and seekability is most of the point.
- **Verbatim relay.** Manifests and segments pass through unmodified, so an HLS
  playlist keeps its full segment list and its `#EXTINF`,
  `#EXT-X-MEDIA-SEQUENCE` and `#EXT-X-BYTERANGE` tags. Rewriting a manifest is
  how seeking silently breaks.

Security: loopback-only, and it serves nothing but URLs explicitly published to
it, each behind a 128-bit token. It is a context-injecting relay for streams the
user chose, not a general forward proxy — something that guessed the port still
cannot make it fetch anything. It is also optional: if it cannot listen, Watch
falls back to the raw URL.

Verified against a real origin server across 15 proxy cases, all passing:
full-body relay; a range request coming back as `206` with exactly the requested
bytes and an intact `Content-Range`; Referer, User-Agent and Cookie each
observed arriving upstream; an HLS manifest relayed byte-for-byte with its
timing tags; and an unpublished token refused with 404.

**Still missing from §10–§11:** segment assembly (turning HLS into one seekable
progressive stream, which is what would actually fix classic mplayer), the
tee-to-disk trick that makes a live stream scrubbable, and cookie capture — the
context currently carries the page URL as Referer and the browser's User-Agent,
but cookies are only replayed if a caller supplies them, since reading them back
needs cookie-store integration.

**Routing the browser through it is deliberately not attempted.** §10's other
use — response inspection for real Content-Types and manifest bodies — means
intercepting HTTPS, which means terminating TLS with a generated certificate the
browser must be made to trust. That is a different problem with its own risks,
and the design does not currently address it.

## What is next (in order)
- **Remaining gaps**, listed per step above — the local proxy (§10) is the
  biggest single unlock, since it covers stream assembly, request context for
  external players, and response-level filtering at once.
- **Android phase (deferred).** System WebView backend, adaptive drawer layout,
  Intent-based player handoff, Android Autofill, SAF downloads (arch §19).

## Open decisions and risks

- **Decided:** AI provider = local-first, Claude default external, others later
  (arch §9.1).
- **Spikes to run early:** the `QGraphicsProxyWidget` geometric-scale path for
  kiosk (may render black on some GPUs), and local-model tree-sort quality.
- **Interceptor limits:** request-only — no inline-script blocking, no response
  headers; the optional local proxy (arch §10) is the upgrade path.
- **Thread note:** `qtwebengine_interceptor::interceptRequest`, and so
  `request_filter::decide`, may run off the UI thread; the policy_engine is only
  mutated on the UI thread and reads tolerate a stale snapshot. Revisit if
  mutation frequency grows.

## Code style and file naming

Same three rules as `../fuzzypickles` (`code-style.md` there has the worked
examples and the reasoning):

- **`snake_case`, not `camelCase`,** for identifiers this project defines. This
  holds in Qt C++: call Qt's own `camelCase` API exactly as it is
  (`setSourceModel`, `addWidget`), and keep every Qt virtual you override under
  its real name (`interceptRequest`, `closeEvent`, `lessThan`,
  `filterAcceptsRow`, `rowCount`, `data`) — but names *you* introduce stay
  `snake_case`, including classes (`policy_engine`, not `PolicyEngine`),
  enums, signals, and slots.
- **Tabs for indentation, spaces for alignment** — one tab per nesting level,
  spaces after the tabs for anything lined up within a line, so alignment
  survives at any tab width. **Do not run `clang-format`**; with no config it
  defaults to spaces and silently undoes this.
- **Lowercase filenames,** `snake_case`, except where a tool won't accept it
  (`CMakeLists.txt`, `LICENSE`, `AndroidManifest.xml`).

Hydra-specific, on top of those:

- C++ member variables take an `m_` prefix and are otherwise `snake_case`
  (`m_views_by_id`, `m_save_timer`).
- Pointers and references bind to the name: `QWidget *parent`,
  `const QString &path`.
- No project-wide identifier prefix (fuzzypickles' `fzp_`). Deliberate: the
  codename is provisional, and a prefix would make renaming cost more than the
  one `project()` line it currently costs.
- `#pragma once`, headers alongside sources, one class per file.
- Qt 6, C++17, Qt **Widgets only** — do not introduce QML/Qt Quick.
- Keep the platform-neutral core (`tab_tree_model`, `tree_outline`,
  `policy_engine`, `state_store`, `tree_sort_proxy`) free of platform APIs;
  platform-specific behavior goes behind interfaces (the WebView-backend seam,
  arch §19.2).
- Persisted files live next to the tree file: `policy.json`, `state/<id>.blob`.

One naming wrinkle worth knowing: the architecture doc's tri-state `Default`
state is spelled `policy::setting::unset` in code, because `default` is a
keyword. It means the same thing — no rule at this scope, fall through to the
global default.

## Commit conventions

- **No AI-attribution trailers** (`Co-Authored-By: Claude ...` and the like) in
  commit messages, and nothing elsewhere in the repo indicating AI involvement.
  Messages end at their real content.
- Documentation changes ride along with the code commit they describe rather
  than landing on their own.

## Licence

**GPL-3.0-or-later.** Full text in `LICENSE`; every source file carries an
`SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0-or-later` line rather than a copyright block.

This sits correctly under the Qt WebEngine dependency, which is
LGPLv3 / GPL / commercial (arch §2) — note that Qt WebEngine's own licensing
constrains distribution independently of what Hydra declares, so re-check it
against any distribution plan.

## Naming

"Hydra" is a working codename. Renaming = the `project()` line in
`CMakeLists.txt` plus the `hydra` target; nothing else depends on the name. The
architecture doc still carries the older codename "Browser Overlord" in its
title — same project.
